Hi there 👋, I am Ruibin Zhang, a fourth-year PhD Candidate from [FAST Lab](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab) at Zhejiang University, fortunately advised by Professor [Fei Gao](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/fei-gao/).

My current research interest lies in data-driven environment perception applied on mobile robots (e.g., UAVs, self-driving cars). Specifically, my recent studies focus on robust sensing modalities such as mmWave radars, aiming to facilitate all-weather safe navigation in various challenging environments. I have also committed to designing novel and elegant autonomous robot systems such as [Terrestrial-Aerial Bimodal Vehicles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdb5mK9OKIo) and [Target-Tracking UAVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8ECy6rgYa8&t=11s)
